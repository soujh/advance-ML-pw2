# advance-ML-pw2

The goal of this practice work is to choose a model and  optimize it. 

The feature engineering is already done (already proposed rather .. we can still continue it but this is
not our goal today)

What we need to do : 
* Select a good model (the best one ... would be pretentious)
At least 3 differet algorithms, with justification of hyperparamter tuning
* Exploring this model : important features, at least
*  Optimize the model
The target is to use just the minimum useful features, keeping the performance.
What is the use of this operation ?
